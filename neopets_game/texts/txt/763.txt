Help Flippy The Dog fight the evil Cog Mr. Hollywood.First, visit the shop and select your Gags. You only get 100 Jellybeans, so choose wisely. Gags have different prices and do different damage. You can see information about each Gag by moving your mouse over the icon.To fight Mr. Hollywood, choose a stance (move forward, move back, or stand still), a tactic (scare or lure), and a gag. Then, click "Go!" and watch the meter. When the meter's in the green, press the button again to launch your gag.
